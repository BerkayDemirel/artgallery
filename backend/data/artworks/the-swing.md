# The Swing

The Swing (French: L'Escarpolette) is an 18th-century oil painting by Jean-Honoré Fragonard in the Wallace Collection in London. It is considered to be one of the masterpieces of the Rococo era, and is Fragonard's best known work.

The painting depicts an elegantly dressed young woman on a swing. A smiling young man, hiding in the bushes on the left, watches her from a vantage point that allows him to see up her dress. The lady is believed to be the mistress of the Baron de Saint-Julien, who is said to have commissioned this portrait of his mistress.

## Artistic Significance

The painting is notable for its playful eroticism and its embodiment of the Rococo style. The composition is dynamic, with the swing moving from lower left to upper right, and the young man positioned to observe the lady's legs as her skirt billows open during the swing.

The color palette is characteristic of Rococo, with soft pinks, blues, and greens dominating the scene. The lush garden setting, with its classical statuary and abundant foliage, creates a sense of secret pleasure and hidden delights.

The Swing exemplifies the Rococo focus on lighthearted, intimate scenes rather than the grand historical or religious subjects favored in earlier periods. It captures the aristocratic pursuit of pleasure and the frivolous, sometimes decadent atmosphere of pre-Revolutionary France.
