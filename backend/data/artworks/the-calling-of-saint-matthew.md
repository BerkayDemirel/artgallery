# The Calling of Saint Matthew

The Calling of Saint Matthew is a masterpiece by Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio, created between 1599 and 1600. It shows the moment when Jesus Christ inspires Matthew to follow him. It hangs in the Contarelli Chapel in the church of the French congregation, San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, where it remains to this day.

The painting shows the moment when Jesus Christ (standing, finger outstretched at the right) inspires Matthew to follow him. Matthew was a tax collector, and the painting shows him seated at a table with four other men, counting money. Christ has entered the room, accompanied by Saint Peter, but only Matthew has noticed their presence.

## Artistic Significance

The Calling of Saint Matthew is a cornerstone of Baroque painting, exemplifying the style's dramatic use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) and its emotional intensity. Caravaggio's innovative approach to religious subjects, depicting sacred events with gritty realism and contemporary settings, was revolutionary.

The painting's composition is masterful, with the light from an unseen source (symbolizing divine inspiration) illuminating the scene. The gestures of the figures create a visual dialogue: Christ points to Matthew, who in turn points to himself as if asking "Me?"

The use of contemporary clothing rather than historical costumes was controversial but made the biblical story more immediate and relatable to viewers. This approach reflected the Counter-Reformation emphasis on making religious narratives accessible to ordinary people.

Caravaggio's naturalistic depiction of the figures, with their individualized faces and expressions, broke with idealized religious imagery and established a new paradigm for religious art that influenced generations of painters.
