# The Baroque Period

The Baroque is a style of architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture, and other arts that flourished in Europe from the early 17th century until the mid-18th century. In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century.

## Origins and Development

The Baroque style began in Rome, Italy, as a response to the Protestant Reformation. The Catholic Church, through the Council of Trent, had decided that art should communicate religious themes and direct emotional involvement in response to the Protestant Reformation. The aristocracy also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumph, power, and control.

Baroque palaces were built on an expanded and monumental scale in order to display the power and importance of the centralized state, a phenomenon best displayed in the royal palace and gardens of Versailles. The style was characterized by new explorations of form, light and shadow, and dramatic intensity.

## Art and Architecture

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance.

Among the greatest painters of the Baroque period are Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Rubens, Vel√°zquez, Poussin, and Vermeer. Caravaggio is an heir of the humanist painting of the High Renaissance. His realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.

Baroque architecture was designed to create spectacle and illusion. Buildings were constructed with a central mass, often with a dome, and then extended with wings and secondary masses. The architecture often used curved lines, and the interiors were often opulent, with large ceiling frescoes, marble in different colors, and gilded surfaces.
