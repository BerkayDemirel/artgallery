# Backend Development Plan for Online Art Gallery Website

## Overview

This plan details the step-by-step development process for the backend of the Online Art Gallery Website. This plan is designed for Developer 2, who is responsible for database, API endpoints, and content generation.

## Responsibilities

- Database design and implementation using Supabase
- API endpoint development with Node.js
- AI content generation pipeline
- Security, performance, and deployment

## Integration Points

1. **API Contract** - Providing endpoints for frontend consumption
2. **Data Schema** - Maintaining shared data structures
3. **Image Storage/Retrieval** - Managing artwork images in Supabase
4. **Newsletter Form** - Processing form submissions from frontend


## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… Artsy API Integration
  - Implemented authentication with Artsy API
  - Created client for making API requests
  - Developed service for processing and saving artwork data
  - Added rate limiting to respect API constraints
  - Implemented image downloading and storage
  - Created script for fetching predefined list of artworks
  - Added unit tests for all components
  - Added fallback mechanisms for missing data
